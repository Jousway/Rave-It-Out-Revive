# Rave It Out
The Official Rave It Out theme. Pitbull would approve. Dale!

## Usage
Works on 5.1-beta2 and 5.0.12 only. Some features will be missing if you do not compile the latest 5.1-new branch of StepMania.

Configure the groups for Easy and Special mode in 01 Utilities.lua.

Supports Dance and Pump mode, although the graphics will still be for pump. (May support other modes too, but you'll probably get some bugs)

## Features that require the latest StepMania

## Configuration

Check the operator menu.

## Adding new songs

Check Song Structure Documentation.txt.
