# Rave It Out: Season 2
![Rave It Out](Graphics/logo.png)
The Official Rave It Out theme. Pitbull would approve. Dale!

## Usage
Works on 5.0.12+ only. Auto Velocity will not work if you do not compile the [latest 5.1-new branch](https://github.com/stepmania/stepmania/tree/5_1-new) of StepMania or [our fork](https://github.com/RhythmLunatic/stepmania/tree/starworlds).

Configure the groups for Easy and Special mode in 01 SYSTEM_PARAMETERS.lua.

Supports Dance and Pump mode, although the graphics will still be for pump. (May support other modes too, but you'll probably get some bugs)

## Configuration

Check the operator menu. Edit 01 SYSTEM_PARAMETERS.lua.

## Adding new songs

Check Song Structure Documentation.txt.
